A tab is what a pane is dragged out INTO (§4.4), so the pane comes with it and a tab with no pane never exists. This file is also the single declaration of the tab shape; the other tabs.* results reference it cross-file. What is NOT here is as deliberate as what is: the activity indicator, the attention indicator and the label are computed from the tab's panes (§4.5) and have no field, because attention arrives at a PANE and a copy on the tab would give one fact two owners.
