# AGENTS.md — Working rules for AI agents on `nocx`

`nocx` is a local-first, Warp-style terminal (Go backend + xterm.js frontend + Wails v2
desktop). This file is the operating contract for **any** AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor,
OpenCode, …) contributing to the repo. Read it before writing code.

## Read first (sources of truth)

- [`docs/vision.md`](docs/vision.md) — what we're building, MVP scope, roadmap.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — the architecture spine: invariants
  (`AD-1`…`AD-10`), module boundaries, the WebSocket protocol. **The ADs are binding.**
- The task backlog lives in **beads** (`bd`), not in prose. Get work with `bd ready`.

## Repository layout

- `docs/` — living source-of-truth docs (`vision.md`, `architecture.md`, `decisions/` ADRs).
- `AGENTS.md` — this file (the agent rules). `CLAUDE.md` only points here.
- `_bmad/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.opencode/` — vendored BMAD agent tooling.
- Code directories appear as the app grows — follow the module map in `docs/architecture.md`.

## How we work

1. Take a `ready` task from beads (`bd ready`); mark it in-progress.
2. Read the relevant `AD`(s) in `docs/architecture.md` before touching a boundary.
3. **TDD**: red → green → refactor. Write the failing test first.
4. Keep it green: language-specific format, lint, and tests all pass (pre-commit runs them).
   The pre-commit hook is the gate on every commit; CI validates release branches and tags.
5. Update the task in beads; record any non-obvious decision as an ADR in `docs/decisions/`.

## Engineering rules (non-negotiable)

- **Interface-first + DI.** Every module lives behind an interface, wired at a single
  composition root. Depend on abstractions, obey SRP, keep modules trivially replaceable.
- **Quality gates from every commit:** language-specific formatting, linting, and test,
  enforced by the pre-commit hook. Mandatory tests for every language — Go and TypeScript
  are held to the same bar.
- **Observability:** structured logging via Go `log/slog` behind the logging interface —
  no ad-hoc `fmt.Println`.
- **Clean-only:** no backward-compatibility shims (greenfield — break & refactor freely),
  no dead code (delete it), no quick-win hacks. YAGNI — don't build speculative features.
- **Respect the spine.** Don't violate an `AD` to save time; if an `AD` is wrong, change it
  in `docs/architecture.md` deliberately rather than routing around it. E.g.: never wrap PTY
  bytes in JSON-RPC (AD-1 data plane); the backend never sniffs the byte stream (AD-6);
  session-id is server-authoritative (AD-7).

## Stack

- **Backend:** Go — `pty`, `ssh` (via `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`), `session`, `transport`,
  `config`. One core, multiple build targets.
- **Frontend:** xterm.js (WebGL) + TypeScript UI. Terminal render state lives here (AD-6).
  wterm remains switchable behind `TerminalRenderer` for re-testing — see
  [ADR-0001](docs/decisions/0001-xterm-js-as-vt-frontend.md).
- **Desktop shell:** Wails v2 (macOS first).
- **Transport:** one WebSocket — raw **binary** data plane + **JSON-RPC 2.0** control plane (AD-1).

## Current top risk

The VT-frontend risk was settled in
[ADR-0001](docs/decisions/0001-xterm-js-as-vt-frontend.md).
Next risk to watch: run `bd ready`.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
