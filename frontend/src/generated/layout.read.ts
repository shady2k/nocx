/**
 * Result of the layout.read JSON-RPC method (nocx-isoph.4, design .internal/specs/2026-08-16-tabs-panes-and-blocks-design.md §4.1 and §4.5): the WHOLE durable chain — every workspace, every tab and every pane — as one snapshot. This is the read the twelve write methods of nocx-isoph.2 were missing, and without it 'order, activation and decoration come from the backend' could not be true: a renderer that cannot read the layout back has to remember it, and a fact the renderer remembers is a fact the renderer owns. Reloading the renderer alone, without restarting the backend, is what this answers — the colours, the names, the order and the pinning come back because they were never in the renderer to begin with. ONE call rather than a list method per rung: the three collections are read under the content domain's single operation lane, so they are one consistent picture rather than three that a mutation can interleave with, and the renderer's first draw is one round trip rather than 1 + N + N·M. FLAT LISTS rather than a nested tree, for the same reason there is no third word between workspace and pane: the workspace, tab and pane shapes are each declared exactly once (workspaces.create, tabs.create, panes.create) and are referenced here, so a nested copy would be a second declaration of all three; the edges are already on the rows (a tab names its workspace, a pane names its tab).
